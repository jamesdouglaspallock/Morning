/**
 * Choice Properties Full QA Scan Prompt
 *
 * Task: Perform a comprehensive QA scan of all dashboards (Tenant, Landlord, Agent, Lease/Payments)
 * and profile pages (Agent, Landlord, Tenant, Owner) for both data accuracy and visual polish.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * 1. Data Verification
 *    - Check all stats cards (Total Properties, Occupancy, Applications, Revenue, etc.) display the correct live data.
 *    - Ensure API endpoints (/api/v2/*) are used correctly and returned data maps to the frontend fields.
 *    - Verify owner/agent information is shown on property details pages (name, profile photo, email if available).
 *    - Confirm role-based access: Tenant, Landlord, Agent dashboards show only relevant data.
 *
 * 2. Visual & UI Consistency
 *    - Hero sections: verify gradient backgrounds, title/subtitle typography, and button sizing (h-11, font-medium).
 *    - Cards: confirm rounded-xl, standardized padding (p-8 for main, p-6 for stats), hover-elevate applied, subtle borders.
 *    - Avatars: size w-14 h-14, verified badge h-6 w-6 in -bottom-2 -right-2 position, strokeWidth=1.5.
 *    - Icons: all Lucide icons use strokeWidth={1.5} and consistent sizing across dashboards/profiles.
 *    - Empty States: verify standardized layout with h-20 w-20 icons, bold primary text, muted secondary text.
 *    - Buttons: consistent height, font weight, hover states.
 *
 * 3. Interaction & Micro-Interactions
 *    - Check hover, focus, active states for cards, buttons, tabs, and banners.
 *    - Ensure smooth transitions (transition-all, duration-200) on interactive elements.
 *    - Confirm mobile responsiveness: stat grids collapse correctly, tabs scroll horizontally, spacing consistent.
 *
 * 4. Accessibility & Professional Polish
 *    - Verify proper aria-labels on icon-only buttons.
 *    - Check color contrast for readability in both light/dark mode.
 *    - Confirm consistency in typography hierarchy (uppercase tracking-widest for secondary labels, font-semibold for stats).
 *
 * 5. Output
 *    - Generate a structured report with:
 *      a) Dashboard/Profile name
 *      b) Data issues (if any)
 *      c) Visual inconsistencies (if any)
 *      d) Interaction/UI glitches
 *      e) Mobile responsiveness observations
 *
 * Goal: Ensure all dashboards and profiles fully align with the Choice Properties premium SaaS visual and functional standards.
