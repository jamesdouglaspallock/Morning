/**
 * GOAL:
 * Ensure that the entire Property Application form is fully validated before submission,
 * including fields skipped or modified during step navigation, and that any
 * business logic rules are enforced at submission-time.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * 1. Global Pre-Submit Validation:
 *    - Trigger validation for all fields in the form using react-hook-form's form.trigger().
 *    - Catch any fields skipped during step-level navigation.
 *    - Ensure that conditional fields (e.g., creditCheckAuthorized, feeAcknowledged, electronicConsent)
 *      are validated according to the property context.
 *    - Display all validation errors in inline messages and/or toast notifications.
 *
 * 2. Submission-Time Checks (Business Logic Layer):
 *    - After passing Zod validation, run additional runtime checks in the onSubmit handler:
 *       a. Confirm that the selected property still has availability.
 *       b. Verify that the uploaded documents are present and meet minimum requirements.
 *       c. Check any conditional business rules (e.g., screening fees or tenant-specific requirements).
 *    - Prevent submission if any runtime business rules fail, with clear error messaging.
 *
 * 3. Integration:
 *    - Use applyFormSchema (Zod) as the single source of truth for types and field validation.
 *    - Keep React Hook Form integration intact.
 *    - Ensure submission sends data to api/v2/applications endpoint without bypassing backend.
 *
 * 4. AI TASKS:
 *    - Implement global pre-submit validation logic that runs before final submission.
 *    - Implement submission-time business logic checks in onSubmit.
 *    - Provide clear inline or toast notifications for errors.
 *    - Ensure that all conditional validation rules are properly handled based on property context.
 *
 * 5. NOTES:
 *    - This prompt focuses only on **global pre-submit validation and runtime checks**.
 *    - Do NOT modify step-level validation or field-level Zod schemas (already handled in previous steps).
