PROMPT: Full Sign-Up Flow Audit for Choice Properties

Objective:
Scan and analyze the entire sign-up / registration flow in the Choice Properties project. Identify functional, visual, validation, and security issues, and generate a detailed report with actionable improvements.

Scope:
- Pages/Components: sign-up.tsx, auth-form.tsx, register.tsx, any multi-step registration components
- Hooks/Services: useAuth, API calls to /api/v2/auth/signup or similar endpoints
- Fields: Name, Email, Phone, Password, Role selection (Tenant, Landlord, Agent, Owner), optional fields (Bio, Location)

Checklist:

1. Data & Functional Integrity:
   - Ensure all input fields are properly mapped to backend API payload.
   - Confirm role selection works correctly and assigns proper default values in the database.
   - Verify that the API responses are correctly handled (success, error, validation messages).
   - Check if duplicate emails / usernames are prevented.
   - Confirm that all required fields are enforced and optional fields are properly handled.

2. Validation & Security:
   - Frontend validation:
       - Email format
       - Password strength
       - Required fields
   - Backend validation:
       - Confirm backend mirrors frontend rules
       - Proper error codes/messages
   - Password handling:
       - Passwords are hashed and never returned
   - Rate-limiting / brute-force protection checks
   - Role-based restrictions: user cannot assign themselves a role they shouldn’t have

3. UI/UX & Visual Design:
   - Layout and spacing of the form: consistent with dashboards and profiles
   - Buttons: size, hover effects, text, and alignment
   - Error messages: clear, consistent, color-coded
   - Responsive behavior: works on mobile and desktop
   - Multi-step forms (if any): progress indicators, step validation, and user-friendly navigation

4. Accessibility:
   - Ensure all fields have labels, aria attributes, and keyboard navigation
   - Proper color contrast for text and input borders
   - Screen reader compatibility for error messages

5. Interactions & Micro-Polish:
   - Loading states on submit buttons
   - Smooth transitions for input focus/blur
   - Feedback for success or failure after submit

6. Final Deliverable:
   - Generate a detailed report in markdown with:
       - Inventory of all sign-up pages and components
       - High-impact functional issues
       - Medium-impact visual/UX improvements
       - Minor refinements / micro-interactions
       - Security and accessibility observations
       - Prioritized recommendations and code-level suggestions
