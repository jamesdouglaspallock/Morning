# Replit AI Audit Prompt: Notifications System Scan

Task: Perform a comprehensive audit of the Choice Properties notifications system across the application (Tenant, Landlord, Agent dashboards, and any profile/lease updates). Detect gaps, inconsistencies, and potential improvements.

1. **Scope**
   - Notification types:
     • Application status changes (Approved, Pending, Rejected)
     • Lease updates and sent documents
     • Payment reminders and overdue alerts
     • Property listing updates (for owners and agents)
   - Frontend components: notification panels, dropdowns, banners, toasts, or in-app alerts.
   - Backend: APIs that trigger notifications (email, push, or in-app events).

2. **Audit Goals**
   - Verify that all notifications are correctly triggered and displayed to the appropriate user roles.
   - Check for missing notifications for critical actions (e.g., payment failures, new lease sent, application review).
   - Identify inconsistent UI patterns in notification display (card style, banners, toasts, icons, colors).
   - Examine role-specific visibility: tenants should not see landlord-only notifications, etc.
   - Check data flow: ensure notifications are properly fetched, updated, and marked as read.
   - Ensure error handling for failed fetches or delivery.

3. **UX & Visual Assessment**
   - Evaluate visual consistency with existing dashboards and profile pages (fonts, colors, spacing, icons).
   - Check responsiveness on mobile screens (collapse behavior, horizontal scrolling, etc.).
   - Assess interactive elements: marking as read, dismissing notifications, linking to relevant pages.

4. **Security & Privacy**
   - Confirm that users can only see notifications relevant to their own account.
   - Sensitive information (payment, email, lease info) should not be exposed improperly.

5. **Deliverables**
   - Full inventory of current notification types, triggers, and UI components.
   - List of missing or inconsistent notifications, prioritized by impact.
   - Suggestions for UX, visual polish, and micro-interactions.
   - Optional: propose a consistent notification component structure for reuse across dashboards.

Instructions:
- Scan both frontend and backend.
- Provide structured output like a full report or table.
- Include actionable improvements for missing notifications, UI inconsistencies, and performance/security gaps.
