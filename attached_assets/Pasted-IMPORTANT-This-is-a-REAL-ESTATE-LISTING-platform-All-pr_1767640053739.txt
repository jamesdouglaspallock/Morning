IMPORTANT:
This is a REAL ESTATE LISTING platform.
All property information MUST come directly from the database.
Do NOT invent, hardcode, infer, or default any property data.

Scope:
Property Details Page ONLY (React frontend).

PRIMARY RULE:
The database (property creation/upload) is the single source of truth.
The UI must render ONLY what exists in the fetched property record.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. DATA AUTHORITY
- Every visible field on the Property Details page must be mapped directly to a database field returned by the property fetch API
- If a value does not exist in the fetched data, the UI element must be hidden entirely
- No placeholder text, no marketing copy, no fallback values

2. PROPERTY FETCH
- Use the existing property fetch logic (do not change API endpoints)
- Do NOT reshape or guess the response
- Only read from the returned property object

3. IMAGE HANDLING
- Display ONLY real property images fetched from the database
- Preserve image order as stored
- If no images exist, show a neutral “Images coming soon” state
- Do NOT use stock, AI-generated, or local placeholder images

4. FIELD MAPPING RULES
- Price → database price field
- Beds / Baths / Sqft → respective numeric fields
- Address → database address fields
- Description → database description
- Amenities → amenities array from database
- Status → listing status from database
- Owner / Agent info → only if present in database

5. CONDITIONAL RENDERING
- Hide any section where all underlying data is missing
- Hide individual rows if a specific field is null or undefined
- Never display assumed defaults (location, year built, utilities, etc.)

6. ACTIONS
- Contact / Inquiry form must reference the correct property ID from the database
- Save / Favorite must store the database property ID
- Share must use the property’s real URL/ID

7. FORBIDDEN
- No hardcoded values
- No subjective labels
- No marketing language
- No fallback locations or coordinates
- No fake “featured” or “verified” states

8. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT modify backend code
- Do NOT change API contracts
- Do NOT refactor unrelated components
- Keep existing React structure

After completion:
- Return a clear list of every property field displayed
- For each field, specify which database field it is mapped to
