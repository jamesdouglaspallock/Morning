IMPORTANT:
This is a REAL ESTATE LISTING platform with REAL data.
The database is the single source of truth.

Scope:
Property Details Page ONLY (React frontend).

DO NOT:
- Create or modify database tables
- Change backend APIs
- Invent fields or relations
- Add placeholder or fake data

Goal:
Redesign the Property Details page so that ALL displayed information is dynamically rendered from existing backend data only.

PAGE STRUCTURE (DATA-DRIVEN):

[property_address]
[property_city], [property_state] [property_zip]

[monthly_rent]/month
[utilities_included_text] (render only if present)

[property_type] | Available: [availability_date]

---

QUICK FACTS (render rows only if data exists):
- [bedroom_count] Bedrooms
- [bathroom_count] Bathrooms
- [square_feet] SQFT
- Built in [year_built]
- [price_per_sqft] per SQFT (use DB value if present; do not compute unless already implemented)

---

OVERVIEW
[property_description] (hide section if empty)

---

AMENITIES
- Populate ONLY from existing relational data if available
- Render amenity_name with included/excluded indicator
- If no amenities exist, hide section entirely

---

LOCATION HIGHLIGHTS
- Populate ONLY from existing location-related data if available
- Do NOT add default or fallback locations
- Hide section if empty

---

ADDITIONAL DETAILS (render rows conditionally):
- Lease Terms: [lease_terms]
- Pet Policy: [pet_policy]
- Parking: [parking_info]
- Laundry: [laundry_info]

---

PROPERTY ACTIONS
- Save Property (use existing favorite logic if implemented)
- Share (use existing share behavior if implemented)
- Contact Agent (must submit with correct property_id)
- Schedule Tour (ONLY enable if already implemented; otherwise hide)

DATA RULES (STRICT):
1. Every bracketed field must map directly to an existing backend field
2. If a field is null or undefined, hide the UI element
3. Do NOT display assumed defaults
4. Do NOT calculate new values unless already part of the system

DESIGN RULES:
- Zillow / Apartments.com style
- Image-first, calm, structured
- No marketing language
- Mobile responsive
- Use existing design system / CSS

After completion:
Return a clear list showing:
- Each UI section
- Which backend fields it is mapped to
- Which sections are conditionally hidden
