Objective: Upgrade the user profile components for Choice Properties to professional, trustworthy, and dynamic layouts while keeping all backend data fully functional. Do not touch existing database schema or property-related components; only focus on the user profile UI/UX and dynamic integration.

Tasks:

1. **Scan Existing Profile Components**
   - Analyze tenant-profile.tsx, owner-profile.tsx, landlord-profile.tsx, agent-profile.tsx, property-manager-profile.tsx (if exists).
   - Identify all fields currently fetched from the backend (users table and joined tables like agencies, properties).
   - Check for any private fields exposed publicly (email, phone) and note them for conditional rendering.

2. **Dynamic Data Mapping**
   - Ensure all user fields are pulled dynamically from the backend: fullName, profileImage, bio, location, specialties, yearsExperience, totalSales, licenseNumber, licenseVerified, agency info, managed properties, etc.
   - Implement conditional rendering for empty fields to avoid broken UI.

3. **Professional Layout & Visuals**
   - Header: Display user profile picture, full name, role, and dynamic verification badge (licenseVerified or verified landlord/manager).
   - Sections: 
     - **Overview/Bio**: user bio and location.
     - **Professional Stats**: Years Experience, Total Sales, Listings Managed (role-specific).
     - **Trust & Verification**: Badges for licenseVerified, verified property owner/manager.
     - **Contact Section**: Only display public-facing email/phone (displayEmail/displayPhone), use internal inquiry system for public users.
   - Use a modern, clean card/grid layout inspired by Zillow and Apartments.com agent/owner profiles.
   - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

4. **Interactivity**
   - Profile picture upload for agents, landlords, and managers.
   - Dynamic badges for verification and professional stats.
   - Live update: Changes in profile immediately reflect on public profile and associated property cards.

5. **Audit & Suggest Improvements**
   - Provide a report on missing fields, UI inconsistencies, and areas for visual improvement.
   - Suggest enhancements for trust signals, spacing, font hierarchy, and visual flow.

**Important Notes:**
- Do NOT modify existing property components or property gallery.
- Focus purely on user profile components and dynamic backend integration.
- Output a clear suggestion for a modernized profile design with code snippets where appropriate.
