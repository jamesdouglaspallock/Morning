PROMPT: End-to-End Verification of Property Application Form

MODE: AUDIT + VERIFY ONLY  
IMPORTANT: Do NOT refactor, redesign, or add new features unless a blocking issue is found.  
Goal is to CONFIRM correctness, not introduce changes.

CONTEXT:
We have a multi-step Property Application form built with:
- React
- react-hook-form
- Zod validation
- Supabase backend (applications table, JSONB fields)
- Step-based ApplicationWizard

TASK:
Scan the Property Application system END-TO-END and verify that it works correctly from first input to final submission.

SCOPE OF VERIFICATION:

1️⃣ FRONTEND FORM BEHAVIOR
Verify the following:
- All steps render the correct input fields
- Required fields are clearly marked and enforced
- Field-level validation runs on blur/change
- Error messages display immediately when input is invalid
- SSN field correctly accepts exactly 4 digits and shows correct errors
- Users CANNOT proceed to the next step if required fields are missing or invalid
- Step progress only advances when validation passes
- Errors are cleared correctly when fields are fixed

2️⃣ STEP-LEVEL VALIDATION
Confirm:
- Each step validates ONLY its own fields on "Next"
- No step allows bypassing required inputs
- Optional steps do not block progress
- Final submit triggers full-form validation

3️⃣ CONDITIONAL LOGIC
Verify:
- Property-specific rules (screening required, fees, disclosures) behave correctly
- Conditional fields are validated ONLY when required
- No silent validation failures occur
- No hidden required fields block submission

4️⃣ DATA INTEGRITY
Confirm:
- Form data maps correctly to application schema fields
- JSONB sections (personalInfo, rentalHistory, employment, documents) populate correctly
- Draft auto-save (if present) does not corrupt validation state

5️⃣ SUBMISSION FLOW
Verify:
- Submit button is disabled or blocked until all validations pass
- onSubmit is reached only with valid data
- API request payload is complete and valid
- Backend accepts submission without errors
- Application status updates correctly after submission

6️⃣ ERROR HANDLING
Confirm:
- No "nothing happened" scenarios exist
- All validation failures produce visible user feedback
- Backend errors (if any) surface correctly to the UI

DELIVERABLE:
Return a concise VERIFICATION REPORT containing:
- ✅ Confirmed working areas
- ⚠️ Minor UX inconsistencies (if any)
- ❌ Blocking issues (if found)
- Exact file names + functions where issues exist
- Clear PASS / FAIL verdict for production readiness

DO NOT:
- Rewrite the system
- Add features
- Change architecture
- Enter implementation mode unless a CRITICAL blocker is found

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Verification Summary
Frontend Validation: PASS / FAIL
Step Navigation: PASS / FAIL
Conditional Logic: PASS / FAIL
Submission Flow: PASS / FAIL
Overall Production Readiness: PASS / FAIL
