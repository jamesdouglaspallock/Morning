PROMPT: Property Application Form Validation Improvements

CONTEXT:
We have a multi-step Property Application form built in React using react-hook-form and Zod for validation. Currently, the form has the following issues:

1. The SSN field asks for the last 4 digits, limits input to 4 digits, but shows an error message "SSN must be 9 digits".
2. Users can proceed to the next steps without filling required fields in each step.
3. Errors are only displayed on final submission, not during input or step navigation.
4. Some conditional fields (like creditCheckAuthorized, feeAcknowledged) cause silent validation failures depending on property-specific flags.

TASK:
Update the Property Application form validation to:

1. **SSN Field**
   - Accept exactly 4 digits.
   - Show the correct error message "SSN must be exactly 4 digits".
   - Ensure only numeric input is allowed.

2. **Step-Level Validation**
   - Each step should block the user from moving forward if required fields in that step are missing or invalid.
   - Use `form.trigger(stepFields)` for validation when clicking "Next".

3. **Field-Level Validation**
   - Enable real-time validation (onBlur or onChange) so that users get instant feedback when leaving a field.
   - Display all error messages using `<FormMessage />` or similar, directly from the Zod schema.

4. **Conditional Validation**
   - Fields like `creditCheckAuthorized`, `feeAcknowledged`, `electronicConsent` should only be required when the property context requires them.
   - Implement `.superRefine()` in Zod or step-specific runtime checks to enforce these rules without causing silent failures.

5. **Submission Safety**
   - On final Submit, trigger a full form validation to ensure no skipped or unvalidated fields.
   - Ensure all errors are displayed clearly and prevent submission until all validations pass.

6. **Consistency**
   - Keep all error messages centralized in the Zod schema.
   - Avoid generic messages; provide clear, professional, user-friendly guidance for each field.

DELIVERABLE:
1. Updated Zod schema for the form, including correct SSN validation and conditional rules.
2. React form code changes that implement:
   - Step-level validation.
   - Real-time field-level validation.
   - Proper error message display.
3. All logic must respect the existing multi-step workflow and submit data to the current API endpoints without bypassing the backend.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not remove or alter existing fields unless required for validation fixes.
- Preserve current styling and layout of the form.
- Validation should work seamlessly with react-hook-form + Zod integration.
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing draft-saving and data persistence logic.

OUTPUT:
Provide only the **updated React and Zod code** required to fix these issues. Do not write implementation instructions.
