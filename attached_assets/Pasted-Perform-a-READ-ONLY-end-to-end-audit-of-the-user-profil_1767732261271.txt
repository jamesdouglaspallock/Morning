Perform a READ-ONLY, end-to-end audit of the user profile system to identify gaps, risks, and improvement opportunities.

Scope:
- Use ONLY confirmed backend data and existing pages.
- Do NOT invent fields, features, or UI elements.
- Do NOT modify code.
- Do NOT assume all roles share the same profile behavior.

Tasks:

1. ROLE-BASED PROFILE AUDIT
Analyze each existing profile page separately:
- renter (tenant-profile)
- landlord / owner (owner-profile, landlord-profile)
- agent (agent-profile)
- property_manager
- admin (if applicable)

For each role:
- List which backend fields are currently displayed.
- Identify important PUBLIC fields that exist in the users table but are not shown.
- Identify any fields being shown that should NOT be public based on privacy or security.

2. PUBLIC VS PRIVATE PROFILE SEPARATION
Audit how public-facing profiles (e.g. agent or property owner shown on a listing) differ from private account dashboards.

- Confirm that public profiles ONLY expose safe fields:
  (fullName, profileImage, bio, location, specialties, yearsExperience, rating, reviewCount, totalSales, agency)
- Identify any risk of leaking private fields (email, phone, auth, security, login metadata).
- Confirm displayEmail and displayPhone are consistently respected.

3. PROPERTY ↔ USER DATA FLOW VALIDATION
Validate the end-to-end flow:
- Property creation → owner_id / listing_agent_id
- Property fetch → joined user object
- Property details page → profile preview (owner/agent card)

Check:
- Are there missing joins?
- Are any user fields referenced on the UI that are not guaranteed by the backend?
- Is role-based logic correctly enforced (e.g., renter never shown as agent)?

4. DATA COMPLETENESS & TRUST SIGNALS
Evaluate whether the following backend fields are used effectively:
- licenseVerified (agents)
- agencyId / agencies table
- yearsExperience, specialties
- rating, reviewCount, totalSales

Identify:
- Which trust signals are underutilized or missing from the UI.
- Whether empty or unverified data is handled gracefully.

5. UX & PROFESSIONALISM REVIEW
Compare the current profile layouts against professional real-estate platforms (Zillow-level quality).

Audit:
- Information density (too much / too little)
- Visual hierarchy
- Role clarity (can users immediately tell who they’re viewing?)
- Mobile behavior consistency

6. ISSUE & IMPROVEMENT REPORT
Produce a structured report with:
- Confirmed issues (backend-backed only)
- Privacy risks (if any)
- UX weaknesses
- Missed opportunities using EXISTING data
- Clear recommendations (NO implementation yet)

Output format:
- Executive Summary
- Role-by-Role Findings
- Data Flow Issues
- Privacy & Security Risks
- UX / Professionalism Improvements
- Final Recommendations

This is an audit and planning task only. Do not redesign or refactor code.
