Project Task: Implement Dynamic Property Poster Display System

Objective:
Update the Choice Properties project to dynamically fetch and display poster information for all properties, ensuring the system is professional, role-aware, privacy-conscious, and consistent across the platform.

Requirements:

1. Backend Improvements:
   - Ensure property API endpoints (e.g., `GET /properties/:id`, `GET /properties`) hydrate full poster profiles:
     • Include name, avatar, role, and organization (if any).
     • For landlords: return `name`, `avatar`, role = "Property Owner".
     • For property managers or agencies: return `name` or team names, role = "Property Manager/Agency", organization logo/avatar if available.
   - Consolidate legacy routes (`server/routes/properties.ts`) to use modern module-based logic (`server/modules/properties/`) for consistent profile hydration.
   - Maintain security: never expose private emails or phone numbers; use `display_email` and `display_phone` fields only if explicitly allowed.

2. Database Considerations:
   - Confirm the relationships:
     • Individual Owner → owner_id
     • Listing Agent → listing_agent_id
     • Organization/Agency → agency_id
   - Backend queries must join these tables correctly to return full profile objects instead of just IDs.

3. Frontend Improvements:
   - Update `PostedBy` component:
     • Dynamically display poster name as registered in dashboard.
     • Display role-specific title:
       - Landlord → "Posted by Property Owner"
       - Property Manager / Agency → "Posted by Property Manager / Management Team"
     • Show avatar or organization logo if available.
     • Optionally display phone/email using `display_email`/`display_phone` only when privacy rules allow.
   - Update `PropertyCard` (search results) to include poster info (name, role, avatar) for transparency.
   - Update `PropertyDetails` page to reflect full poster info in a professional layout.

4. UI/UX Standards:
   - Ensure consistency across dashboards (Tenant, Landlord, Manager).
   - Include role badges or small labels to clearly indicate poster type.
   - Use subtle hover or click effects on poster info (optional).
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness and clean layouts.

5. Legacy System Handling:
   - Detect and update any old code paths that bypass modern hydration logic.
   - Ensure all endpoints return consistent full profile objects.

6. Testing & Verification:
   - Verify properties posted by landlords show "Property Owner" with correct name/avatar.
   - Verify properties posted by managers/agencies show proper titles and organization branding.
   - Ensure no private data leaks (emails/phone numbers).
   - Test PropertyCard, PropertyDetails, and PostedBy components for dynamic display.
   - Confirm both new and legacy routes return consistent data.

Deliverables:
- Fully updated backend endpoints with proper profile hydration.
- Updated `PostedBy` component.
- Updated `PropertyCard` and `PropertyDetails` components.
- Documentation/comments for future developers on how poster info is fetched and displayed.
- Verified privacy and security rules for all displayed fields.

Instructions for Replit AI:
- Scan the project to locate all existing `PropertyCard`, `PostedBy`, `PropertyDetails` components and backend property routes.
- Identify any legacy code that bypasses modern hydration logic.
- Implement the above improvements end-to-end, ensuring professional, consistent, and dynamic display of poster information across all user roles.
- Keep the implementation modular, reusable, and compliant with privacy/security standards.
