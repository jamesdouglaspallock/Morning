READ CAREFULLY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.

ROLE:
You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer performing a **read-only end-to-end audit** of the property creation and property details system.

TASK GOAL:
1. Verify that the **property creation form/system** collects and sends all necessary fields correctly to the backend.
2. Verify that the **property details page** displays all data from the backend correctly.
3. Identify any missing fields, mismatched mappings, or risks.
4. Produce a structured, comprehensive report.

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT modify frontend code
- DO NOT modify backend code
- DO NOT modify database schema
- DO NOT redesign any UI
- DO NOT invent fields or fake data
- USE ONLY what exists in the system

---

SCOPE:

### 1. Property Creation System
- Identify all input fields collected in the creation form (Form field names + type + required/optional)
- Map each field to the corresponding backend field and database column
- Verify that all **required backend fields** are sent correctly
- Identify mismatches between form naming, API, and database
- Identify optional fields that are missing from the form or API
- Verify correct handling of arrays / nested objects (amenities, utilities, images)
- Verify that all validation logic (backend and form) matches

### 2. Backend & Database
- List all property-related database tables and columns
- List foreign key relations
- List API endpoints for creating/updating/fetching properties
- Document expected data types, optional vs required

### 3. Property Details Page
- List all fields currently rendered on the frontend
- Map each displayed field to the backend field
- Identify any fields stored in the database but not displayed (unused fields)
- Identify any fields displayed but not actually stored or sent by the backend

---

OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED):

### PROPERTY CREATION FORM
- Field Name | Form Name | Backend Field | DB Column | Type | Required | Notes

### DATABASE STRUCTURE
- Table | Columns | Relationships

### API ENDPOINTS
- Endpoint | Method | Fields Sent | Fields Returned

### PROPERTY DETAILS PAGE
- Field | Rendered? (Yes/No) | Backend Field | Notes

### GAPS & RISKS
- Missing fields
- Mismatched types
- Unused stored fields
- Fields displayed but not stored
- Any other potential risk

---

FINAL RULES:
- This is a **read-only discovery**. Do NOT implement, redesign, or modify anything.
- Do NOT guess or invent fields.
- Only report what exists in the system.
- Be thorough, structured, and clear.
