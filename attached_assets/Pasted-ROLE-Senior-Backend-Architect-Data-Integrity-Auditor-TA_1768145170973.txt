ROLE: Senior Backend Architect & Data Integrity Auditor

TASK:
Enforce a strict rule that Property Rules displayed anywhere in the platform (Application page, Property Details, Pre-Apply screens, PDFs) must originate ONLY from data explicitly entered during Property Creation or Property Editing.

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1. NO additional rules may be generated, inferred, defaulted, or injected at runtime.
2. NO global platform rules, AI-generated text, or fallback values are allowed.
3. If a rule field is empty or NULL on the property record, it MUST NOT appear in the UI.
4. The property record is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.

SCOPE:
- Property Rules display on:
  - Rental application page
  - Property details page
  - Application review & submission summary
  - Downloadable PDFs (applications / disclosures)
- Property Rules input via:
  - Property creation flow
  - Property editing flow

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. Audit the property schema and identify all rule-related fields (explicit columns + JSON fields).
2. Create a strict allowlist of rule fields that are permitted to be exposed.
   Example:
   - application_fee
   - pets_allowed
   - pet_restrictions
   - smoking_allowed
   - max_occupancy
   - income_requirement
   - available_from
   - custom_rules (only if explicitly saved by owner)
3. Implement a `getPropertyRules(property)` selector that:
   - Extracts ONLY allowlisted fields
   - Filters out NULL, empty strings, empty arrays, and empty objects
   - Returns a read-only rules object
4. Ensure NO business logic mutates or augments this rules object.

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. Property rules UI components must:
   - Render only keys returned from the backend selector
   - Use conditional rendering (do not show missing rules)
   - Never introduce text not present in the API response
2. Remove any hard-coded labels such as:
   - “Standard rules apply”
   - “Platform policy”
   - “Typical requirements”
3. If the rules object is empty:
   - Display nothing (no placeholder messaging)

APPLICATION FLOW RULES:
1. The rental application page must:
   - Fetch property rules via property ID
   - Display rules as read-only
   - Require applicant acknowledgment ONLY for rules that exist
2. On application submission:
   - Persist a snapshot of the rules exactly as received
   - Do not re-fetch or re-compute rules after submission

SECURITY & LEGAL SAFETY:
1. Do NOT expose internal policy text.
2. Do NOT infer Fair Housing or legal disclosures as “rules”.
3. Rules must be owner-defined, not platform-defined.

VERIFICATION STEPS (REQUIRED):
1. Scan codebase for:
   - Hardcoded rule strings
   - Default rule fallbacks
   - Rule text defined outside property flows
2. Remove or refactor any violations.
3. Confirm via test:
   - Property with minimal data shows minimal rules
   - Property with no rules shows no rules
   - Editing property rules updates future applications only

DO NOT:
- Redesign UI
- Change business logic
- Add new fields
- Add defaults
- Add AI-generated content

GOAL:
Ensure the platform behaves professionally, legally, and predictably by guaranteeing that Property Rules are derived EXCLUSIVELY from owner-entered property data — nothing more, nothing less.
