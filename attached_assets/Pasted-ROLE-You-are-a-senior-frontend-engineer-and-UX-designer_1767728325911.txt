ROLE:
You are a senior frontend engineer and UX designer. Your task is to redesign the Property Card component for a real estate platform so that it is **clean, high-conversion, and professional**, similar to Zillow, Apartments.com, or OpenDoor.

GOAL:
Create a Property Card that **displays only essential property information**, encourages clicks to the Property Details page, and avoids clutter or overpopulated fields.

TASKS:

1️⃣ **Essential Fields Only**
- Main image: images[0] (largest and visually prominent)
- Price: price per month (overlay or top of card)
- Property title and address: title, city, state
- Quick stats: bedrooms, bathrooms, square_feet (with clean icons)
- Status / listing_status (Available / Off Market)
- Optional small badges: pets_allowed, furnished
- **Remove**: amenities list, application fee, utilities, full description, view/save counts, lease terms

2️⃣ **Layout & Design**
- Desktop: horizontal or card grid layout, clean spacing, hover elevation effects
- Mobile: vertical stacked layout, image on top, stats below
- Visual hierarchy: Image → Price → Title/Address → Quick Stats → Optional Badges
- High-conversion: card encourages **clicking anywhere on the card** to go to the property details page

3️⃣ **Actions**
- Minimal: Optional Save/Favorite icon (small, subtle), optional Share icon
- **Apply Now button should NOT be on the card** — leave it for the Property Details page
- Conditional rendering: only show badges or icons if data exists

4️⃣ **Dynamic Data**
- All displayed information must be pulled from the backend properties table
- Conditional rendering for missing or null fields
- Avoid any hardcoded placeholders

5️⃣ **Professional Visuals**
- Clean modern font, spacing, and borders
- Rounded corners, subtle shadows
- Hover/active effects for desktop (scale, shadow, elevation)
- Consistent iconography for quick stats

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Fully dynamic, clean Property Card component
- Mobile-responsive and professional design
- Only essential property info shown
- Clickable card that drives users to Property Details page
- Ready for production
