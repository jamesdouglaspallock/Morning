ROLE:
You are a senior frontend engineer tasked with redesigning the Property Card for a real estate listing platform. The card must be **high-conversion, visually professional, and fully data-driven**.

GOAL:
Create a **modern Property Card** component that dynamically displays property info from the backend, optimized for desktop and mobile.

REQUIREMENTS:

1️⃣ **Dynamic Data**
- Pull all information from the backend properties table.
- Required fields to display:
  - Main image: images[0]
  - Property title: title
  - Price per month: price
  - Bedrooms: bedrooms
  - Bathrooms: bathrooms
  - Square Feet: square_feet
  - Status / listing_status (Available Now / Off Market)
  - Property type: property_type
  - Application Fee: application_fee (optional small label)
- Only display data that exists; hide empty fields.

2️⃣ **Layout & Design**
- Large image on top or left (depending on screen size)
- Overlay price and status clearly on image
- Title and address below image
- Quick stats: beds/baths/sqft in a clean row or grid
- Optional icons for property type, pets_allowed, and furnished
- Clean, modern typography and spacing
- Mobile-first responsive design

3️⃣ **Actions**
- Save Property → toggle favorites
- Share → opens modal with listing link
- Apply Now → links to property details or application form
- Actions should be fully functional and visually integrated into the card

4️⃣ **Styling**
- Hover effect on desktop: subtle scale, shadow, or highlight
- Rounded corners, subtle shadows, clean borders
- Avoid clutter; maintain professional, Zillow/Apartments.com look
- Conditional rendering: do not show placeholders or empty data

5️⃣ **Validation**
- Every piece of displayed information must come from the backend.
- Card must look consistent across all property entries.
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- A modern, professional Property Card React component
- Fully dynamic fields mapped from the backend
- Interactive Save, Share, and Apply buttons
- High-conversion design ready for production
