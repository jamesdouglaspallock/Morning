ROLE:
You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the Choice Properties platform.

TASK TYPE:
Targeted implementation update (DO NOT refactor unrelated logic).

GOAL:
Implement a professional “Off Market” property display behavior WITHOUT changing:
- existing property fetching logic
- database schema
- hydration logic
- property visibility rules
- ownership / role logic

Only update UI behavior and conditional rendering.

--------------------------------
BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

When a property is marked as "off_market":

PUBLIC PROPERTY CARD:
1. The property card MUST remain visible in public search results.
2. Display a clear OFF MARKET badge at the top of the card.
3. Show ONLY:
   - Thumbnail image
   - Property title
   - City / general location
4. Disable or hide:
   - Image carousel
   - Save / Favorite button
   - Apply button
   - Interactive hover effects
5. Visually indicate disabled state:
   - Slight opacity reduction OR desaturation
   - Cursor should indicate non-actionable state

--------------------------------
PROPERTY DETAILS PAGE (PUBLIC)
--------------------------------

When visiting an off-market property details page:

1. Display ONLY:
   - Thumbnail image (no gallery)
   - Property title
   - Basic metadata (beds, baths, size — if already loaded)
   - Poster information (owner / manager)
   - OFF MARKET badge
2. Show a clear informational notice:
   “This property is currently off market and not accepting applications.”
3. Hard-disable:
   - Image gallery
   - Amenities
   - Full description expansion
   - Application flow
   - Contact actions
4. This page must NOT:
   - 404
   - Redirect
   - Appear broken or incomplete

--------------------------------
OWNER / MANAGER DASHBOARD
--------------------------------

For property owners and managers:
- Off-market properties must retain FULL functionality
- Editing, images, and relisting must work normally
- No restrictions should apply in dashboard views

--------------------------------
TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------

DO NOT:
- Change API responses
- Change property hydration logic
- Change database fields
- Introduce new statuses
- Move business logic to the frontend

ONLY:
- Use existing `listing_status === "off_market"` condition
- Apply conditional UI rendering
- Apply visual styling changes only

--------------------------------
FILES TO UPDATE (ONLY IF NECESSARY)
--------------------------------

- client/src/components/property-card-enhanced.tsx
- client/src/pages/property-details.tsx
- Shared UI components if already used for badges or notices

--------------------------------
QUALITY RULES
--------------------------------

- Maintain current UI style and design system
- Follow existing badge and status patterns
- Keep behavior intentional and professional
- Do NOT introduce regressions

--------------------------------
OUTPUT EXPECTATION
--------------------------------

- Implement conditional UI behavior cleanly
- No breaking changes
- No new APIs
- No schema changes

Proceed with implementation now.
