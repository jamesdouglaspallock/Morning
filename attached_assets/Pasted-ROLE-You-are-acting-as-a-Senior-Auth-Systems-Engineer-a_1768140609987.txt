ROLE:
You are acting as a Senior Auth Systems Engineer and Validation Debugger.

TASK TYPE:
Audit + Fix (Scoped, non-autonomous)

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Renter (tenant) signup is failing with a generic error:
"failed to sign up, unable to proceed, required"
The UI does not show what is required, and signup cannot complete.

OBJECTIVE:
Scan the full signup flow and identify exactly why renter signup fails, then implement precise fixes so renter signup works reliably and displays clear validation errors.

SCOPE:
Focus ONLY on signup (not login).

FILES TO AUDIT:
- client/src/pages/signup.tsx
- client/src/lib/auth-context.tsx
- server/modules/auth/auth.routes.ts
- server/modules/auth/auth.service.ts
- server/modules/auth/auth.repository.ts
- shared/schema.ts (users table)
- Any Zod or validation schemas related to signup

AUDIT CHECKLIST:
1. Frontend
- Verify what fields are collected for renter signup
- Verify role value sent (tenant vs renter)
- Confirm required fields match backend expectations
- Check how errors are caught and displayed

2. Backend
- Identify required fields when creating a user profile
- Confirm role-based requirements (tenant vs landlord vs agent)
- Identify which required field is missing during renter signup
- Verify Supabase auth user creation vs profile insertion order

3. Validation
- Check Zod or schema validation rules
- Ensure renter role has minimal required fields
- Remove landlord/agent-only requirements from renter signup

4. Error Handling
- Ensure backend returns clear error messages
- Ensure frontend displays the exact backend error
- Remove generic "failed to sign up" masking

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Renter signup must only require renter-appropriate fields
- Role-based validation must be explicit
- Error messages must clearly state which field is missing
- Do NOT change business logic unrelated to signup
- Do NOT introduce autonomous refactors

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Renter signup completes successfully
- Missing fields show specific error messages
- No silent failures
- No partial Supabase users created
