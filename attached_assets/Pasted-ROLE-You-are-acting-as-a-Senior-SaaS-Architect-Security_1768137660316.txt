ROLE:
You are acting as a Senior SaaS Architect, Security Auditor, and Compliance Systems Reviewer.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
This is a multi-role real estate SaaS platform (Choice Properties) with tenants, landlords, agents, and admins. The goal of this task is to AUDIT ONLY the Admin / Super Admin capabilities that currently exist in the project.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT implement new features
- DO NOT refactor code
- DO NOT change logic
- DO NOT add files
- DO NOT assume missing features exist
- This is a READ-ONLY AUDIT

OBJECTIVE:
Scan the entire codebase and produce a detailed audit of all ADMIN and SUPER ADMIN capabilities, permissions, access paths, and gaps.

SCOPE OF AUDIT:
Focus ONLY on admin-level functionality, including but not limited to:

1. ROLE & PERMISSION MODEL
- Identify all roles defined in the system (admin, landlord, agent, tenant, etc.)
- Determine if there is a distinct “super admin” or “master admin” role
- Document how admin permissions are enforced (middleware, service checks, RLS, etc.)
- Identify any hardcoded role checks or implicit admin access

2. ADMIN ACCESS POINTS
- Identify any admin-only routes (API + frontend)
- Identify admin dashboards, panels, or hidden routes
- Verify how access is restricted (route guards, backend validation)
- Identify any admin routes that lack proper protection

3. ADMIN OVERRIDE CAPABILITIES (IF ANY)
Audit whether admins can currently:
- Override application status
- Reopen or modify submitted applications
- Override scoring decisions
- Modify lease states
- Disable or suspend users
- Edit or delete properties they do not own
If these do NOT exist, clearly state they are missing.

4. COMPLIANCE & AUDIT TOOLS
Check for the existence of:
- Application status history visibility for admins
- Lease signing logs (timestamps, IP, user agent)
- Disclosure acceptance tracking
- Payment audit logs
- Admin-readable activity logs
Clearly note what is visible to admins vs landlords vs agents.

5. DATA VISIBILITY & SAFETY
- Determine what sensitive data admins can see (SSN, documents, payments)
- Verify if access is logged or restricted
- Identify any privacy risks or overexposure

6. UI / UX FOR ADMINS
- Identify any admin-facing UI components
- Determine if admin actions are distinguishable from landlord actions
- Identify missing UI indicators for “admin override” actions

7. SECURITY & RISK ANALYSIS
- Identify risks related to admin abuse or lack of audit trails
- Identify missing safeguards (approval requirements, logging, confirmations)
- Identify any admin actions that are irreversible or untracked

DELIVERABLE FORMAT:
Produce a structured audit report with the following sections:
- What Admin Capabilities Currently Exist
- What Is Missing or Incomplete
- Security & Compliance Risks
- Architectural Observations
- Readiness Level (Prototype / Beta / Production-Ready)

FINAL INSTRUCTION:
This is an AUDIT ONLY.
Do not propose solutions or implementation steps unless explicitly identifying gaps.
Do not write code.
Do not modify files.
