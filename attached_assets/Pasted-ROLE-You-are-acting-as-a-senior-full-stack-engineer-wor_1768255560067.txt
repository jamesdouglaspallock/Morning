ROLE:
You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer working inside an existing production codebase.

CONTEXT:
This project is called “Choice Properties”.
It is a rental platform with an existing application form and authentication system.
This task is ONLY to create a Legal & Disclosures system foundation.
Do not refactor, optimize, or touch unrelated systems.

VERY IMPORTANT SCOPE LIMITS:
You may ONLY do the following:
- Create a new page component for legal documents
- Create a simple, structured data model (static for now) for legal content
- Add routing/navigation to access the legal page

You MUST NOT:
- Modify the tenant application form
- Modify authentication logic
- Modify payment logic
- Modify database schemas
- Add backend APIs
- Change existing UI components

FILES YOU MAY CREATE OR MODIFY:
- client/src/pages/Legal.tsx (or Legal.jsx depending on project setup)
- client/src/data/legalDocuments.ts (new file)
- client/src/routes or router config file (ONLY to register the new page)

TASK:
Create a professional, Zillow-style “Legal & Disclosures” page that displays legal documents in a clear, trustworthy, and modern way.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. The Legal page must:
   - Look professional, clean, and trustworthy
   - Be suitable for sensitive legal and compliance content
   - Work on both desktop and mobile
   - Use neutral colors, good spacing, and readable typography

2. Legal content must be structured into categories:
   - Terms of Service
   - Privacy Policy
   - Rental Application Terms
   - Fair Housing Notice
   - Background & Credit Check Disclosure
   - Electronic Consent & Signature Disclosure

3. Each category must:
   - Have a title
   - Have a short summary/description
   - Expand to show full content (accordion or section layout)

4. Content source:
   - Use a static data file (legalDocuments.ts)
   - Each document must include:
     - id
     - title
     - category
     - lastUpdated (date string)
     - content (placeholder legal text, clearly marked)

5. UX & Trust Indicators:
   - Show “Last Updated” for each document
   - Display a notice such as:
     “These documents govern your use of Choice Properties and tenant applications.”

6. Routing:
   - Add a route like /legal
   - Ensure it does not interfere with existing routes

OUTPUT CHECK (MANDATORY):
When finished, the project must have:
- A visible /legal page accessible via URL
- A clean, readable legal layout
- Legal content loaded from a centralized data file
- NO changes to the application form or backend logic

STOP CONDITION:
After completing this task, STOP.
Do not suggest further improvements.
Do not continue to Phase 2.
