SYSTEM ROLE:
You are acting as a Senior SaaS Architect and Rental Compliance Engineer.
Do NOT refactor unrelated logic.
Do NOT change how data is fetched unless explicitly instructed.
Work incrementally and safely.

TASK:
Implement a professional, property-scoped “Property Rules” system that is fetched from a property and displayed clearly during the rental application flow, with legal acknowledgment before submission.

SCOPE (VERY IMPORTANT):
• This logic applies ONLY to the property application flow.
• Do NOT create global rules.
• Do NOT invent new rules.
• ONLY read and display rules that already exist or are explicitly defined on the property record.

STEP 1 — PROPERTY RULES SOURCE OF TRUTH
Audit the property schema and identify all rule-related fields already stored on a property, including but not limited to:
• pet policy
• smoking policy
• occupancy limits
• income requirements
• HOA requirements
• application fee
• any JSON / metadata rule fields

If any rule data is stored in JSON or metadata, map it safely without restructuring.

STEP 2 — FETCH RULES IN APPLICATION FLOW
In the property application page (apply flow):
• Fetch property rules using the property ID already available in the route
• Fetch rules ONCE when the application loads
• Do NOT refetch on every step
• Do NOT block the application yet

STEP 3 — EARLY READ-ONLY DISPLAY (INFORMATIONAL)
Add a clearly labeled section near the top of the application UI:

“Property Rules & Requirements”

Display rules in a clean, modern, readable format:
• Bullet list or badges
• Icons allowed but optional
• Human-readable language (no legal jargon)
• Read-only (no checkboxes here)

Examples:
• No smoking
• Pets allowed (cats only)
• Maximum occupancy: 3 people
• Minimum income: 3× monthly rent

STEP 4 — ACKNOWLEDGMENT STEP (MANDATORY)
Near the final step of the application wizard:
• Re-display the same property rules
• Add a required acknowledgment checkbox:
  “I have read and agree to the property rules and requirements listed above.”

Rules:
• Submission MUST be blocked until this checkbox is checked
• The acknowledgment state must be saved with the application
• Do NOT submit without acknowledgment

STEP 5 — RULE SNAPSHOT SAFETY
When the application is created:
• Save a snapshot of the property rules with the application record
• Do NOT rely on live property rules after submission
• This snapshot protects against rule changes mid-application

STEP 6 — BLOCKING VS INFORMATIONAL RULES
Categorize rules internally as:
• Blocking (e.g. max occupancy exceeded, pets not allowed)
• Informational (e.g. quiet hours, HOA rules)

Behavior:
• Blocking rules may show warnings or prevent submission
• Informational rules require acknowledgment but do not block

Do NOT auto-reject silently.
Always show clear messaging to the applicant.

STEP 7 — LEGAL & TRUST REQUIREMENTS
Ensure:
• Rules are visible before submission
• Rules are acknowledged before submission
• Acknowledgment is stored with timestamp
• UI language is neutral and compliant (Fair Housing safe)

Do NOT add legal disclaimers beyond acknowledgment yet.

STEP 8 — DO NOT TOUCH
• Do NOT modify scoring logic
• Do NOT modify autosave logic
• Do NOT refactor property creation
• Do NOT change backend endpoints unless strictly required
• Do NOT introduce new roles or permissions

DELIVERABLE:
• Property rules fetched and displayed in the application
• Mandatory acknowledgment before submit
• Rules snapshot stored with the application
• Clean, professional, modern UX
• Zero breaking changes

Work step by step and explain changes briefly after each section.
