Scan the Choice Properties project and perform a full audit of the **Property Application System** and **Property Notification System**. Provide a detailed report in sections, including findings, gaps, and prioritized recommendations. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. **Property Application System**
   - Analyze the full lifecycle: from draft → submission → payment → approval/rejection.
   - Inventory the backend logic:
     • Modular services (server/modules/applications/)
     • Legacy helper logic (server/application-service.ts)
     • Identify duplicated or inconsistent status update logic.
   - Review the data model:
     • Multi-step JSONB objects (personalInfo, rentalHistory, employment, documents)
     • status_history JSONB array
     • Snapshots of property data
   - Assess scoring logic:
     • Income, Credit, Rental History, Employment, Documents
     • Check for placeholders or missing integration (e.g., credit API)
   - Evaluate workflow enforcement and role-based security:
     • STATUS_TRANSITIONS state machine
     • isPropertyOwner / isApplicant checks
     • RLS usage
   - Identify high, medium, and low-priority issues for backend logic, scoring, UI/UX, and security.

2. **Property Notification System**
   - Map all backend triggers to frontend display:
     • New Application, Status Change, Payment Received, Lease Signed, Scoring Complete
   - Review frontend components:
     • NotificationBell / UnifiedNotificationBell
     • NotificationsPanel / UnifiedNotificationsList
     • Mobile behavior (Sheet vs Dropdown)
   - Identify gaps:
     • Latency due to polling
     • Missing deep-linking to exact workflow steps
     • Role-based filtering
     • Visual hierarchy of alerts
   - Recommend improvements with priority levels:
     • High: real-time delivery, critical alerts
     • Medium: deep-link routing, category filters
     • Low: visual polish, animations

3. **Combined Recommendations**
   - Merge the Property Application and Notification findings into a single, actionable plan.
   - Include visual refinement suggestions (animations, pulse indicators, context badges).
   - Provide a clear **priority list**: High, Medium, Low.
   - Include both backend, frontend, and UX/UI items.

4. **Output Format**
   - Provide results in clear sections:
     1. Audit Findings
     2. Gaps & Inconsistencies
     3. Prioritized Recommendations (High / Medium / Low)
     4. Visual / UX Refinements
   - Use bullet points and tables where appropriate.
   - Do NOT make any code changes; this is a full audit report only.

Focus on **cohesive SaaS-grade analysis**. Assume all dashboards, profiles, and workflows are already visually polished.
