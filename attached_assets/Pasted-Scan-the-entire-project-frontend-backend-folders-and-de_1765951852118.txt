Scan the entire project (frontend, backend, folders, and dependencies) and enforce a strict, automatic environment-variable configuration system with the following requirements:

1️⃣ Environment Contract
- Create a committed `.env.example` file at the project root
- Include placeholders (no real secrets) for:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
  - Any other env vars currently referenced in the codebase
- Ensure `.env.example` is referenced in documentation

2️⃣ Automatic Environment Validation
- Create `src/lib/env.ts`
- Implement a `validateEnv()` function that:
  - Defines a list of required environment variables
  - Checks `process.env` for missing values
  - Logs each missing variable clearly
  - Throws a hard error if any required variable is missing
- This must fail fast and never allow silent misconfiguration

3️⃣ Startup Enforcement
- Call `validateEnv()` automatically on application startup
- Ensure validation runs:
  - Before Supabase initialization
  - Before rendering the app
- In development, the app should crash immediately with a clear error if env vars are missing

4️⃣ Supabase Safety Guard
- Update all Supabase client/server initialization files to:
  - Explicitly check required Supabase env vars
  - Throw a descriptive error if any are undefined
- Prevent Supabase from initializing with invalid config

5️⃣ Replit-Friendly Behavior
- Do NOT rely on `.env` files for runtime secrets
- Assume Replit Secrets may be missing on first run
- Design the system to guide developers to Replit Secrets automatically

6️⃣ Developer Guidance
- Create or update `SETUP.md` with:
  - Step-by-step instructions for adding Replit Secrets
  - Clear reference to `.env.example`
  - Explanation of startup error messages
- Add concise inline comments explaining why this system exists

7️⃣ Consistency Audit
- Scan the entire codebase for any `process.env.*` usage
- Ensure all referenced variables exist in `.env.example`
- Remove unused or duplicate env variables
- Standardize naming (no mismatched or legacy env names)

8️⃣ Non-Goals (Strict)
- Do NOT add paid services
- Do NOT hardcode secrets
- Do NOT weaken validation
- Do NOT add GitHub or Google OAuth
- Do NOT change application behavior beyond env safety

After implementation:
- Ensure the app fails fast with helpful errors if env vars are missing
- Ensure importing this project into a new Replit account never results in silent Supabase errors
- Ensure future developers cannot run the app incorrectly by accident
