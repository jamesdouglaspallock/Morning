TASK: Apply visual polish improvements to the dashboards based strictly on the completed visual audit.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):
- ❌ Do NOT modify backend logic, APIs, database, or data fetching
- ❌ Do NOT introduce new features or workflows
- ❌ Do NOT refactor business logic
- ✅ Frontend-only, cosmetic changes using Tailwind CSS utilities
- ✅ Changes must be minimal, scoped, and reversible

FILES IN SCOPE:
- renter-dashboard.tsx
- landlord-dashboard.tsx
- tenant-lease-dashboard.tsx
- tenant-payments-dashboard.tsx
- agent-dashboard-new.tsx
- Shared dashboard card and stat components

--------------------------------------------------

VISUAL POLISH CHECKLIST TO IMPLEMENT:

1. TYPOGRAPHY & HIERARCHY
- Use `font-semibold` for stat labels and section titles where clarity is needed
- Ensure `text-muted-foreground` is only used for secondary/supporting text
- Improve label/value contrast in dense lists without changing content

2. SPACING & LAYOUT CONSISTENCY
- Standardize dashboard card padding to `p-6`
- Increase grid spacing on large screens (`gap-6` instead of `gap-4`)
- Ensure consistent vertical spacing between dashboard sections

3. UI CONSISTENCY
- Standardize status badge styles:
  - Pill shape (`rounded-full`)
  - Consistent horizontal padding (`px-3 py-1`)
- Ensure all lucide-react icons use consistent stroke width
  - Prefer `strokeWidth={1.5}` or `strokeWidth={2}` (pick one and apply consistently)
- Align alert banners visually with dashboard tone using subtle backgrounds
  - Example: `bg-blue-50/50`, `border-blue-200`

4. INTERACTION POLISH
- Add subtle hover feedback to interactive cards:
  - `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow`
- Ensure hover effects are consistent across all dashboards

5. EMPTY STATE PRESENTATION
- Center empty state content vertically within cards
- Slightly increase icon size for empty states
- Use descriptive text, no logic changes

--------------------------------------------------

DELIVERABLES:
- Apply the above cosmetic changes only
- Do not alter component props, API responses, or state logic
- Preserve existing layouts and data flow
- Ensure visual consistency across Tenant, Landlord, and Agent dashboards

GOAL:
Improve readability, spacing, and professional polish while keeping functionality unchanged.
