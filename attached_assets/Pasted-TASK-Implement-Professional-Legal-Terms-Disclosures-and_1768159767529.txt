TASK: Implement Professional Legal Terms, Disclosures, and Consent Logic

GOAL:
Add platform-level Terms & Privacy acceptance and application-level legal acknowledgments to the rental application system in a professional, compliant, and auditable way.

SCOPE:
This task applies ONLY to legal content, consent logic, UI checkboxes, and data storage. Do NOT modify business logic, scoring logic, or unrelated UI.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. PLATFORM-LEVEL TERMS & PRIVACY
- Add Terms of Service and Privacy Policy content.
- Require acceptance during account signup.
- Store acceptance in the user record with:
  - terms_version
  - privacy_version
  - accepted_at timestamp
  - accepted_ip
- Do not auto-check or assume consent.

2. APPLICATION-LEVEL LEGAL CHECKBOXES
On the final step of the rental application wizard:
- Add required checkboxes for:
  - Accuracy & Certification
  - Authorization to Verify Information
  - Fair Housing Acknowledgment
  - Electronic Consent & Signature
- These must be REQUIRED before submission.
- Disable submit button until all required boxes are checked.

3. CONDITIONAL DISCLOSURES
- Show Background/Credit Check disclosures ONLY if:
  - application requires screening OR application_fee > 0
- Include:
  - FCRA Authorization
  - Adverse Action Acknowledgment
  - Application Fee Disclosure

4. PROPERTY RULES ACKNOWLEDGMENT
- Display property rules fetched ONLY from the property record.
- Do NOT inject platform-generated rules.
- If rules exist, require acknowledgment checkbox.
- If no rules exist, do not show the checkbox.

5. DATA STORAGE
For each submitted application, store:
- accepted_terms: boolean
- accepted_privacy: boolean
- accepted_application_disclosures: boolean
- accepted_background_check: boolean (if applicable)
- accepted_property_rules: boolean (if applicable)
- accepted_at timestamp
- accepted_ip address
- terms_version used at submission

6. IMMUTABILITY
- Once application status transitions from draft → submitted:
  - Legal acceptance fields become read-only
  - No edits allowed

7. UI & UX RULES
- No pre-checked boxes
- Clear error messages if consent is missing
- Professional language only
- No placeholder text

OUTPUT:
- Legal content rendered cleanly in the UI
- Full audit trail stored in database
- Submission blocked until all required legal consents are completed
