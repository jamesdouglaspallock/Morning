TASK: PROFILE PAGES — VISUAL POLISH (FRONTEND ONLY)

Scope:
- agent-profile.tsx
- landlord-profile.tsx
- tenant-profile.tsx
- owner-profile.tsx (public)

STRICT RULES:
- This is a VISUAL POLISH task ONLY.
- Do NOT touch backend, data fetching, or API logic.
- Do NOT add new functionality.
- Do NOT refactor authentication or role logic.
- Keep all existing dynamic fields intact.
- Use Tailwind CSS / Shadcn/UI utilities only.

OBJECTIVE:
Upgrade the visual styling of all profile pages to match the professional, high-polish standard of dashboards and property cards.

FOCUS AREAS:
1. Avatar & Verification Badge
   - Standardize avatar size (48px) across all profiles.
   - Standardize Verified badge appearance and hover interactions.

2. Hero / Header
   - Use consistent gradient backgrounds across all profiles.
   - Standardize subtitle opacity (text-white/80 or text-muted-foreground).
   - Refine typography: tracking-tight for titles, font-semibold where needed.

3. Stat & Info Boxes
   - Convert all stat cards (Active Properties, Years Experience, Sales, Ratings) to rounded-xl.
   - Add hover:shadow-md and subtle transitions for interactivity.
   - Standardize padding and spacing to match dashboards (p-6 / p-8, gap-6 / gap-8).

4. Forms / Settings Sections
   - Standardize input heights (h-11/12) and borders (border-border/50).
   - Ensure labels use uppercase + tracking-wider for consistency.
   - Match card shadows and rounded corners to dashboard style.

5. Layout & Responsiveness
   - Ensure consistent multi-column layouts (3-column for settings, 2/3 + 1/3 for public profiles).
   - Confirm sticky sidebars have proper padding and spacing on mobile.

6. Buttons & Actions
   - Standardize button styles across all profiles (outline / ghost variants).
   - Match heights (h-11) and spacing to dashboards.

DELIVERABLE:
- All profile pages visually upgraded to match Tenant, Landlord, Agent dashboards.
- Only CSS / Tailwind / Shadcn/UI changes.
- Maintain all dynamic data.
- No backend, API, or logic changes.
