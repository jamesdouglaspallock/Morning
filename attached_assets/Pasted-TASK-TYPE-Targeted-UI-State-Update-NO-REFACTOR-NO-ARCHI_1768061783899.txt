TASK TYPE: Targeted UI + State Update (NO REFACTOR, NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGES)

GOAL:
After a user uploads a profile picture, the new avatar must reflect IMMEDIATELY across the UI
without page refresh, logout, or re-login.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change upload logic
- Do NOT change backend behavior
- Do NOT refactor auth architecture
- ONLY update client-side state handling
- Maintain existing API responses exactly as they are

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — SCAN & UNDERSTAND (READ-ONLY)
--------------------------------------------------

Scan the following files to understand current behavior:
- client/src/components/profile-settings.tsx
- client/src/lib/auth-context.tsx
- Any component rendering user avatars (header, dashboard, PostedBy)

Identify:
- Where the upload request returns the new image URL
- Where user profile data is stored in global state
- Where avatar components read their data from

DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE IN THIS STEP.

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — CLIENT STATE UPDATE (MINIMAL CHANGE)
--------------------------------------------------

After a successful profile image upload:
1. Capture the returned image URL from the upload API response
2. Update the existing authenticated user object in auth-context
3. Ensure the updated avatar URL replaces the old one in memory

Rules:
- Do NOT refetch user data
- Do NOT reload the page
- Use the existing setUser / updateUser pattern
- Preserve all other user fields unchanged

Expected pattern:
- server confirms upload
- client updates user.profile_image immediately
- UI re-renders automatically

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — UI CONSISTENCY CHECK
--------------------------------------------------

Verify that the updated profile image reflects instantly in:
- Profile settings avatar
- Dashboard header avatar
- Property “Posted by” section
- Any other component consuming auth user data

If any component is using a stale local copy:
- Replace it with the centralized auth user state
- Do NOT introduce new state stores

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — FAILURE SAFETY (NO UX REGRESSION)
--------------------------------------------------

If upload fails:
- Do NOT update UI
- Show existing error behavior
- Ensure no broken image placeholders appear

--------------------------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Upload profile picture → image updates instantly
- No page refresh required
- No auth logout/login cycle
- No backend changes
- No new API calls

DO NOT:
- Introduce polling
- Introduce new contexts
- Modify backend routes
- Change storage providers

Proceed only with the scoped client-side changes described above.
