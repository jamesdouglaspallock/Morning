IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT add new major features
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT redesign UI
- Focus ONLY on making the platform stable and clear for rentals

PRIMARY GOAL:
Ensure landlords can post/manage properties
Ensure renters can apply smoothly without confusion

====================================
PHASE 1 — CRITICAL CLARITY FIXES
====================================

1. REMOVE "buyer" ROLE COMPLETELY
- This is a rental-only platform
- Remove "buyer" from:
  - Signup form
  - Role selection UI
  - Backend role validation
  - Any conditional logic
- Ensure existing users with role "buyer" default to "renter"

====================================
PHASE 2 — DASHBOARD FLOW FIXES
====================================

2. FIX RENTER DASHBOARD REDIRECT
- Create a basic renter dashboard route
- Redirect renters there after login
- Minimum content required:
  - List of submitted applications
  - Placeholder text if none exist
- Do NOT add advanced features

3. FIX ROLE SELECTION CONSISTENCY
- Ensure roles shown are consistent everywhere:
  - renter
  - landlord
  - property_manager
- No role should appear in one screen and not another

====================================
PHASE 3 — AUTH & VERIFICATION SAFETY
====================================

4. ADD EMAIL VERIFICATION GATE
- Users must verify email before:
  - Selecting role
  - Accessing dashboards
- If unverified:
  - Show clear message
  - Block progression

====================================
PHASE 4 — CORE FLOW PROTECTION
====================================

5. ENSURE CORE RENTAL FLOWS REMAIN UNTOUCHED
- Do NOT break:
  - Property creation/editing
  - Property browsing
  - Application submission
- If any change affects these flows, revert and log

====================================
EXPLICITLY IGNORE FOR NOW
====================================
- Rent payments
- Lease management
- Maintenance tickets
- Tenant screening automation
- Multi-role accounts
- Property ownership verification

====================================
DELIVERABLE
====================================
Confirm the following after changes:
- No "buyer" role exists anywhere
- Renters land on a dashboard after login
- Role selection is consistent
- Email verification blocks unverified access
- Landlord posting & renter applications still work
