You are a developer and auditor for the Choice Properties platform. The project uses TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. Focus only on **code, architecture, and UI improvements**.

We want to implement improvements for the **Property Application and Notification systems** based on a recent audit.

---

### 1. Backend / Logic Improvements

Tasks:
1. Fully migrate all legacy logic in `server/application-service.ts` into `server/modules/applications/`.
   - Centralize status transitions, scoring, and audit logging.
   - Remove duplicate logic and ensure all functions use the modular service.

2. Implement a **real-time notification system**:
   - Replace 30-second polling in the frontend with WebSocket-based updates using Supabase Realtime.
   - Notifications should update instantly for both Tenant and Landlord dashboards.

3. Integrate **real credit scoring**:
   - Replace placeholder SSN logic (25 points) with API integration (e.g., Plaid/TransUnion).
   - Ensure scoring is accurate and updates the application record automatically.

4. Strengthen **role enforcement and security**:
   - Ensure only `isPropertyOwner` can approve applications.
   - Ensure only `isApplicant` can modify their own applications.
   - Verify RLS policies on the `applications` table fully enforce these roles.

### 2. Frontend / Functional Improvements

Tasks:
1. **Deep-Linking for Notifications**:
   - Update `handleNotificationClick` in `UnifiedNotificationsList` and `NotificationBell`.
   - Clicking a notification should route directly to the specific wizard step or document needing action.

2. **Notification Filters**:
   - Add “Action Required” vs. “All” filters for landlords in the NotificationsPanel.
   - Ensure the UI updates immediately when toggling filters.

3. **Application Wizard UX**:
   - Show autosave or “step saved” toast when a step is completed.
   - Ensure multi-step wizard persists progress if the user navigates away or reloads.

### 3. Visual / Motion Improvements

Tasks:
1. Add subtle **pulse animation** on the Notification Bell icon for high-priority alerts.
2. Implement **Framer-motion slide-and-fade transitions** between ApplicationWizard steps.
3. Add **contextual badges** in the Landlord review panel (e.g., “Top 5% Income”, “Low Risk”) with semantic colors.
4. Align **input heights, card padding, and typography** with the dashboard style (rounded-xl, p-8 for main cards, h-11 for inputs/buttons).

### Instructions for AI

- Only provide **code changes, file paths, and component updates**.
- Do not explain concepts — just give the **code, imports, and any configuration needed**.
- Group output by **Backend, Frontend, and Visual/UI**.
- Make sure all code is **ready to paste and run in a Choice Properties Fast Mode Replit environment**.
- Assume Tailwind, React, TypeScript, and Supabase are fully set up.
