You are acting as a **Senior SaaS Architect and Legal Workflow Auditor**.

## TASK TYPE
🔍 **READ-ONLY AUDIT — DO NOT MODIFY CODE**
❌ No refactors
❌ No new features
❌ No behavior changes
❌ No autonomous execution

Your task is to **fully audit and map the Property Application System** in the Choice Properties codebase and report findings only.

---

## AUDIT OBJECTIVE
Determine why the application flow stalls around ~70–75% completion, why autosave fails, and what is missing for a **100% professional, legal, production-ready rental application workflow**.

---

## SCOPE — YOU MUST SCAN ALL OF THESE

### 1️⃣ FRONTEND — Application Wizard
Scan all files related to:
- ApplicationWizard component
- Step-based forms (personal, rental, employment, documents)
- Autosave logic
- Progress calculation
- Validation behavior
- Error handling when save fails
- What happens after ~75% completion

Identify:
- Which steps exist
- Which steps are missing
- Where autosave breaks
- Whether a final submission step exists

---

### 2️⃣ BACKEND — Application Services & Status Logic
Scan:
- server/modules/applications/
- server/application-service.ts
- Any STATUS_TRANSITIONS or state machines
- Autosave endpoints
- Application create/update logic

Identify:
- Which statuses are implemented
- Which transitions are allowed or blocked
- Whether "submitted" is fully defined
- Whether autosave is allowed in all states
- Where validation rejects saves

---

### 3️⃣ DATABASE SCHEMA
Scan:
- applications table
- JSONB fields
- status and status_history
- required vs optional fields

Identify:
- Fields required to complete an application
- Fields missing for final submission
- Schema gaps preventing submission

---

### 4️⃣ PAYMENT & CONFIRMATION
Scan for:
- Application fee handling
- Payment verification logic
- Receipt or confirmation records
- Submission locking behavior

Identify:
- Whether payment is required to submit
- Whether submission is blocked without payment
- Whether the UI reflects this properly

---

### 5️⃣ LEGAL & TRUST REQUIREMENTS
Verify whether the system includes:
- Consent to background/credit checks
- Fair Housing acknowledgment
- Data privacy consent
- Applicant attestation ("I confirm this is accurate")
- Timestamped submission confirmation

If missing, clearly list them.

---

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

Produce a **single structured report** with these sections:

### SECTION A — What Exists (Confirmed Working)
List implemented features that are functioning correctly.

### SECTION B — Where the Flow Breaks
Explain:
- Why the application stalls around ~75%
- Why autosave fails
- Whether this is frontend, backend, or schema related

### SECTION C — Missing Required Sections
List **missing pages, steps, or logic** required for a legally credible rental application.

### SECTION D — Status & Autosave Analysis
Explain:
- Which statuses allow autosave
- Which should not
- Why autosave currently fails

### SECTION E — Professional SaaS Gaps
List gaps preventing the system from feeling:
- Trustworthy
- Legal
- Confidential
- Production-ready

---

## IMPORTANT RULES
- ❌ DO NOT implement anything
- ❌ DO NOT refactor
- ❌ DO NOT assume missing features exist
- ❌ DO NOT require autonomous mode

This is a **diagnostic audit only**.

Return findings clearly and concisely.
