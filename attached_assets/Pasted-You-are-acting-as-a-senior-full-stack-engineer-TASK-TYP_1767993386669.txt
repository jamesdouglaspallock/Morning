You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer.

TASK TYPE:
Audit → Targeted Fix (NO refactors, NO redesigns, NO new features)

GOAL:
Fix the "Edit Property" experience so that when a user edits an existing property,
all previously saved information is automatically pre-filled in the form instead
of showing an empty form or losing progress.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (READ CAREFULLY):
- Do NOT change backend logic
- Do NOT modify validation rules
- Do NOT affect the "Create Property" flow
- Do NOT refactor unrelated files
- Do NOT introduce new APIs or database changes
- ONLY fix data hydration and form state handling for editing an existing property

---

### SECTION 1 — AUDIT ONLY (DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET)

Scan the project and identify:

1. The page or route used to edit an existing property  
   (example: /dashboard/properties/:id/edit)

2. The React component responsible for the property form  
   (confirm whether Create and Edit share the same form component)

3. Where the property data is fetched during edit mode  
   (API call, hook, loader, or service)

4. How the form state is initialized
   - Identify if default values are empty
   - Identify if fetched property data is ignored or overwritten

5. Any logic that resets or clears the form on:
   - validation errors
   - submit failures
   - ZIP code errors
   - API errors

OUTPUT:
Briefly list:
- The exact file(s) causing the form not to prefill
- The exact reason the form loses existing data

STOP AFTER AUDIT.
DO NOT APPLY FIXES YET.

### SECTION 2 — FORM HYDRATION FIX (TARGETED IMPLEMENTATION)

After confirming the audit findings, apply the following fix:

GOAL:
When editing an existing property, the form must be pre-populated with the
existing property data fetched from the backend.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use the already-fetched property data
- Initialize the form state from this data ONCE when it becomes available
- Preserve all existing form behavior
- Preserve all existing validation logic
- Preserve image previews and existing images
- Do NOT reset the form on validation errors

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- If the form uses React state, hydrate it using useEffect
- Ensure hydration runs only in "edit mode"
- Ensure Create Property mode remains unchanged
- Keep unchanged fields intact when submitting edits

Example logic (conceptual only):
- If propertyId exists AND property data is loaded:
  → populate form state from property data

---

### SECTION 3 — UX SAFETY CHECKS

Ensure the following behaviors are true after the fix:

- Editing a property shows all existing values
- A ZIP code error does NOT clear the form
- A failed submit keeps all user-entered data
- Images remain visible unless explicitly removed
- User can modify only one field and re-submit

---

### SECTION 4 — VERIFICATION

After implementation, confirm:

- Edit Property works correctly
- Create Property flow is unaffected
- No new errors introduced
- No regression in posting properties

DO NOT add new features.
DO NOT refactor unrelated logic.
ONLY fix edit-form prefill behavior.
