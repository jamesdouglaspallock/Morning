You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer and debugger.

I have a full-stack web application with:
- Frontend (React or similar)
- Backend (Node.js + Express)
- Database (MongoDB or equivalent)
- Property listing creation feature (similar to Zillow)

CRITICAL ISSUE:
The property listing creation process is failing or behaving incorrectly.

YOUR TASK:
1. Perform a COMPLETE SYSTEM SCAN of the project:
   - Frontend components related to creating a property listing
   - Backend API routes/controllers/services
   - Database schema/models
   - Middleware (auth, validation, file upload)
   - Environment variables
   - Network requests (request/response mismatch)

2. IDENTIFY ALL ISSUES that could cause property creation to fail, including but not limited to:
   - Missing or mismatched field names between frontend and backend
   - Incorrect request method (POST vs PUT)
   - Wrong endpoint paths
   - Body parsing issues (JSON vs multipart/form-data)
   - Image/file upload errors
   - Schema validation failures
   - Auth/permission issues
   - State management or form submission bugs
   - Async/await or error handling mistakes
   - Database connection or save failures

3. FOR EACH ISSUE FOUND:
   - Clearly explain:
     - Where the issue is located (file + function)
     - Why it breaks property creation
     - What symptom it causes (error, silent failure, wrong data, etc.)
   - Provide a SAFE FIX with corrected code
   - Ensure fixes do NOT break existing features

4. VERIFY DATA FLOW:
   - Trace the full flow:
     Frontend form → API request → backend controller → database save → API response → frontend success handling
   - Confirm that:
     - All required fields are present
     - Types match schema requirements
     - Images/files are handled correctly
     - Errors are properly returned and displayed

5. IMPROVE RELIABILITY:
   - Add missing validation
   - Improve error messages
   - Add logging where necessary
   - Recommend best practices ONLY if relevant

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT guess.
- Do NOT remove features unless necessary.
- Do NOT rewrite the entire app.
- Explain before fixing.
- Use minimal, targeted changes.
- Treat this as a production app.
