You are an expert React developer, UX/UI designer, and product engineer.

Please perform a **comprehensive audit of the Property Details page** in this real estate project, including:
- UI layout and visual design
- User experience (UX)
- Dynamic data rendering
- Code structure and logic
- Performance and accessibility
- Integration with backend data (Supabase / API)

Your task is to **analyze and report only** — do NOT implement or modify any code.

---

### 1. Page Structure & Design
Review the overall layout of the Property Details page:
- Visual hierarchy (what draws attention first, second, etc.)
- Spacing, alignment, and consistency
- Desktop vs mobile responsiveness
- Whether the page feels professional, modern, and trustworthy

Identify any design inconsistencies or layout issues and suggest improvements.

---

### 2. User Experience (UX)
Evaluate how a user interacts with the page:
- Ease of understanding the property information
- Navigation and scrolling flow
- Image gallery integration with the rest of the page
- CTA clarity (contact, inquire, save, etc.)

Identify any friction points or confusion and suggest UX improvements.

---

### 3. Dynamic Data & Logic
Analyze how property data is fetched and rendered:
- Are all property details dynamically sourced from the database?
- Any hardcoded values that should be dynamic?
- Handling of missing or partial data
- Loading states, skeletons, or fallbacks

Highlight any risks, bugs, or improvements related to data flow and reliability.

---

### 4. Code Quality & Maintainability
Review the implementation from a code perspective:
- Component structure and separation of concerns
- Redundant logic or components
- Reusability and scalability
- Potential refactors (suggest only)

Focus on long-term maintainability.

---

### 5. Performance & Optimization
Evaluate:
- Image loading behavior
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Layout shifts or performance bottlenecks
- Opportunities for lazy loading or memoization

Suggest optimizations where appropriate.

---

### 6. Accessibility (A11y)
Check for:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- ARIA attributes
- Contrast, focus states, and semantic structure

Point out any accessibility gaps and improvements.

---

### 7. Content Clarity & Trust
Assess whether:
- Property information is easy to understand
- Labels, icons, and formatting improve clarity
- The page builds user trust (real estate–grade professionalism)

Suggest enhancements that improve credibility and clarity.

---

### Output Requirements
- Structure your response as an **Audit Report**
- Clearly separate:
  - What is working well
  - Issues or weaknesses
  - Suggested improvements (descriptive only)
- Do NOT write or modify code
- Be specific, practical, and actionable

The goal is to fully understand how strong the Property Details page is and what improvements would make it production-grade.
