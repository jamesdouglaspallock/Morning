You are auditing the **Property Application System** of the Choice Properties project. Perform a full audit and generate clear, actionable recommendations. Divide your analysis into the following sections:

---

## 1. Inventory & Flow Mapping
- List all **frontend pages and components** related to property applications:
  - Name
  - File location
  - Purpose
  - How it interacts with applications (view, submit, update)
- List all **backend endpoints** for applications:
  - Endpoint URL
  - Purpose
  - Required parameters
  - Role restrictions
- List all **hooks/services**:
  - Name
  - File location
  - Purpose
  - Data returned
- Provide a **data flow overview** showing how data moves from form submission to backend storage, including any transformations (camelCase vs snake_case).
- Include notes about integration points and potential gaps.

---

## 2. Data & State Analysis
- Audit **field mapping**:
  - Consistency between frontend and backend
  - Missing fields or optional fields not handled
- Audit **validation**:
  - Frontend form validations (required fields, min/max lengths, regex)
  - Backend validations for submitted data
- Audit **conditional rendering**:
  - Handling of missing or incomplete data
  - Edge cases like empty application lists or partially filled forms
- Audit **role enforcement**:
  - Tenants can view/submit only their own applications
  - Landlords/agents can view/manage applications for their properties
  - Unauthorized users cannot access these routes
- Output **list of inconsistencies, missing validations, or potential data issues**.

---

## 3. UI/UX Audit
- Audit **multi-step applications**:
  - Step indicators, progress bars, status badges
  - Clarity of current step vs completed steps
- Audit **loading & empty states**:
  - Skeletons or spinners during API calls
  - Empty states with descriptive text and icons
- Audit **mobile responsiveness**:
  - Grid collapse, scrolling, button alignment
  - Touch targets for interactive elements
- Audit **accessibility**:
  - ARIA labels for icons/buttons
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Color contrast for badges and alerts
- Output **recommendations** for visual polish, interaction improvements, and mobile adjustments.

---

## 4. Security & Role Enforcement
- Audit **route protection**:
  - Authenticated access only
  - Role-specific access for tenants, landlords, agents
- Audit **backend validation**:
  - Prevent unauthorized submissions
  - Verify property ownership before updates
- Audit **duplication & spoofing risks**:
  - Duplicate submissions
  - Data spoofing vulnerabilities
- Output a **prioritized list of critical security gaps and suggested fixes**.

---

## 5. High-Level Recommendations & Enhancements
- List **missing features**:
  - Real-time notifications for status updates
  - Email alerts for tenants/landlords
  - Multi-step progress visibility
- List **visual polish recommendations**:
  - Consistent card padding, hover effects, rounded corners
  - Standardized status badges and typography
  - Mobile-friendly layouts
- List **performance & reliability improvements**:
  - Pagination/lazy loading for large application lists
  - Optimized API calls and caching
  - Better error handling
- Suggest **component/service refactors** and a **checklist for phased implementation**
- Output a **clear, actionable roadmap** in markdown.
