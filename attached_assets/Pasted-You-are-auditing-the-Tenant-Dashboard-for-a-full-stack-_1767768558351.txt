You are auditing the Tenant Dashboard for a full-stack real estate platform. Your task is to perform a **complete front-end and back-end scan** to produce a professional, production-ready audit report. Do not implement any changes yet—just analyze and suggest improvements. Focus on correctness, usability, and security.

Scope:
1. Frontend Components:
   - tenant-dashboard.tsx
   - tenant-profile.tsx
   - applications.tsx
   - favorites.tsx
   - notifications.tsx
   - Any other tenant-specific components

2. Backend Data & API Endpoints:
   - /api/v2/users/:id
   - /api/v2/applications
   - /api/v2/favorites
   - /api/v2/notifications
   - Any other tenant-specific endpoints

Tasks:
1. **Field Mapping**
   - List all backend fields fetched for tenant views.
   - Identify which fields are currently rendered in the frontend.
   - Highlight missing or unused fields.
   - Note any fields that are hardcoded instead of dynamic.

2. **Layout & UI/UX**
   - Evaluate visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography.
   - Identify overcrowded sections or poor information density.
   - Assess responsiveness on desktop and mobile.
   - Highlight confusing or poorly organized interactions.

3. **Functionality Check**
   - Verify actions: applying to properties, viewing applications, favoriting properties, updating profile info, receiving notifications.
   - Identify broken, missing, or placeholder features.

4. **Privacy & Security**
   - Check usage of sensitive fields (email, phone, 2FA secrets, password hashes).
   - Ensure public-facing fields (displayEmail, displayPhone) are used appropriately.
   - Flag any exposed sensitive data.

5. **Performance & UX**
   - Note loading states, spinners, empty states.
   - Identify performance bottlenecks or redundant API calls.

6. **Trust Signals & Suggestions**
   - Suggest improvements: adding stats, summaries, badges, verification, or other signals to improve the professional quality of the tenant dashboard.
   - Highlight any backend gaps that limit frontend display.

Output:
- Provide a structured audit report:
  1. **Field Mapping**
  2. **Frontend Issues**
  3. **Backend Issues**
  4. **Privacy & Security Risks**
  5. **UI/UX Suggestions**
  6. **Functionality Suggestions**
- Include specific component/file references and API endpoints in your audit.

Do not modify any code yet. Focus solely on **scanning, analyzing, and reporting**.
