You are tasked with implementing a **final visual polish** for the Choice Properties project. Focus on dashboards (Tenant, Landlord, Agent, Lease/Payments) and profile pages (Agent, Landlord, Tenant, Owner). All changes must be **code-based**, using Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI components, and existing project conventions. Do not change backend logic or API calls. Follow the checklist below strictly.

---

### Priority 1: High-Impact Visual Issues
1. **Standardize Card Padding**:
   - All major cards: `p-8`, rounded-xl, border `border-border/50`.
   - Sub-cards/stat cards: `p-6`, rounded-xl, hover shadow.

2. **Avatar & Verified Badge**:
   - All avatars: uniform size (w-14 h-14 for main avatars).
   - Verified badge: h-6 w-6, strokeWidth 1.5, positioned `absolute -bottom-2 -right-2`.
   - Ensure fallback initials display correctly.

3. **Hero Section Gradients**:
   - Standardize all dashboards and profile heroes to `bg-gradient-to-br from-primary via-primary/90 to-secondary/80`.
   - Apply consistent padding (`py-12 px-6`) and rounded corners.

4. **Empty States**:
   - Standardize empty state layout using icons (h-20 w-20), bold title, and muted secondary text.
   - Use `Empty` component where possible.

### Priority 2: Medium-Impact Refinements
1. **Interactive Stat Cards**:
   - Apply `hover-elevate hover:shadow-md transition-all` to all stat cards.
   
2. **Icon Stroke Consistency**:
   - All lucide-react icons: `strokeWidth={1.5}`.

3. **Status Badge Styling**:
   - Rounded-full, subtle backgrounds (e.g., `bg-blue-50/50`), consistent font weights.

4. **Button Uniformity**:
   - All primary buttons: consistent height `h-11`, font-medium.

---

### Priority 3: Minor Polish & Micro-interactions
1. **Skeleton Loader Alignment**:
   - Match skeleton heights exactly to final cards.

2. **Typography Hierarchy**:
   - Use uppercase tracking-widest consistently for labels.
   - Ensure all headings, stats, and titles match font sizes from dashboards.

3. **Transitions**:
   - Add `transition-all duration-200` to interactive tabs, card borders, and buttons.

---

### Mobile-Specific Enhancements
1. **Horizontal Tab Scrolling**:
   - Dashboards tabs: `overflow-x-auto -mx-4 px-4`.
   
2. **Responsive Stat Grids**:
   - Stat cards collapse to 1-column on mobile early enough to prevent truncation.

---

### Additional Notes
- Preserve all existing functionality.
- Apply hover, spacing, typography, and card refinements consistently across all dashboards and profiles.
- Ensure the design matches a **premium SaaS feel**.
- Output **only code changes** (JSX/TSX with Tailwind classes). No explanations.

Implement all of the above.
